Balanace App a custom AI driven CRM

Welcome to the Balance App, a comprehensive tool designed to help you manage your time and tasks more effectively.

Time is the most valuable asset we have, and our app aims to put a value on your time through an advanced algorithm. Our AI-assisted scheduling and financial planning features help you balance your workload and make the most of your time, so you can focus on the things that matter most to you.

The main purpose of this app is to make the world a better place by helping individuals achieve a better balance in their lives. We want people to be able to appreciate the more important things and see the bigger picture when it comes to their time allocation.

In order to provide personalized time management and productivity recommendations, the AI will need to gather a variety of data from the user. Some potential data points that will be helpful for the chatbot to understand include:

1: A list of the user's daily tasks and responsibilities, including work tasks, household chores, and other   obligations

2: The time spent on each of these tasks, or an estimate of how long each task typically takes to complete

3: The user's schedule, including any fixed appointments or commitments (such as meetings or classes) and any regularly recurring events (such as a weekly yoga class or a daily commute)

4: The user's goals and priorities, both in terms of work and personal life

5: Information about the user's interests, hobbies, and other leisure activities

This data will be gathered through a variety of means, such as by having the user input their tasks and schedule directly into the chatbot, or by integrating with productivity tools or calendars that the user already uses. The AI will also ask the user questions and gather additional information through the course of its conversations with the user.

Here is the formula that I came up with to calculate the impact of attention deficit disorder (ADD) or an inability to stay focused on the amount of time it takes to complete a task:

Time taken to complete task with ADD or poor focus = Total time to complete task / (1 - (% of time lost to ADD or poor focus / 100))

This formula takes into account the fact that if you have ADD or difficulty staying focused, you may lose a certain percentage of time to distractions, resulting in a longer overall time to complete the task.

For example, if it would normally take you 10 hours to complete a task, and you estimate that you lose 20% of your time to ADD or poor focus, the time taken to complete the task with ADD or poor focus would be calculated as follows:

Time taken to complete task with ADD or poor focus = 10 hours / (1 - (20% / 100))
= 10 hours / (1 - 0.2)
= 10 hours / 0.8
= 12.5 hours

This shows that if you have ADD or difficulty staying focused, you may take 25% longer to complete a task than you would if you did not have these challenges.  Therefore by following a structured schedule provided to you closely you are gaining 25% of your time and time is money.

I hope this helps to illustrate how ADD or poor focus can impact the amount of time it takes to complete a task. Let me know if you have any further questions.

This project was created by Eddie Jordan, a software engineer based in Silicon Valley. The app is built using JavaScript, React, Redux, Node.js, Express, and TypeScript. We hope you find our app useful in your efforts to lead a more balanced and fulfilling life. Thank you for choosing Time Balancer CRM.
